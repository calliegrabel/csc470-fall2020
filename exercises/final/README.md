# Design for Final Exam
## Gameplay Description
Fall Guys is a game that recently came out that was offered for free and I really enjoyed the aspect that there are multiple different mini games that you have to get through. Although my game will obviously not be an multi-player online game, I want to take the same ideas and create mutliple different scenes with unique minigames.
## Input
There will be a platformer character that will go through the minigames by racing through an obstacle course and a maze. There will be a timer count on the minigames that have an obstacle course that counts up to rush the play to complete the course as fast as possible. To jump, the user will hit space and use the other basic controls to turn and move around. 
## Visual Style
The visuals will be very very bright colors, with each scene of each minigame being a different set of bright colors.
## Audio Style
The music is very fast-paced music to encourage the player to rush to complete the course in the fastest amount of time possible. The timer also helps to rush the user, but this intense audio makes the player on edge.
## Interface Sketches
The main screen will allow you to choose your characters color and give it a name. It will have a start button and a section where you choose a color and type your name.
## Story/Theme Description
The game is supposed to be fun and bright for people of all ages to see how quickly they can accomplish different minigames that test their knowledge and gaming ability.

# Set Targets
## Low bar
Two different mini games. One an obstacle course, one a maze. The timer will count up for the obstacle course and for the maze. The obstacle course will have different checkpoints that the player can respawn at if they fall off.
## Expected
This one will do the same as above, but will keep track of high scores, allow the player to change names and colors, and will have music and audio tied to it.
## High-bar
This one will be the same as above, but will have three levels and more audio attached to certain player actions, like jumping. It will also randomize the order of the minigames for the player to go through so that it is not always the same.
## Timeline
Nov 22: Obstacle course design and layout completed

Nov 24: Matching game design and layout completed and Memorization game design and layout completed

Nov 26: Player movement completed,moving platforms on obstacle course completed, matching blocks flipping over when clicked on completed, and lighting up blocks in a random order for memorization game completed

Nov 28: Timer countdown, player crossing finish line completed, checking to see if blocks are matching, and checking if clicking on right order of blocks for memorization is correct

Nov 30: starting over when wrong or fall, overall timer, keeping track of high score, and changing name and color of player
