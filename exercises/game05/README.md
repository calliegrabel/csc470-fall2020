#Interactive World
My game will be similar to Minecraft, but will have animals that you can click on and learn about. The player will be able to move freely around the world and cut down and grow trees. To do this, I will have two buttons. One that, when selected, will allow the player to cut down trees. The other one, when selected, will allow the player to grow trees, but the growth process will take time. The movement of the player will be similar to the platformer game. For the player to interact with animals, they can hover over one of the animals to stop it from moving. Then, when they select the animal, text will pop up to describe the animal so that they can learn about it. If I get far enough, I would like the player to be able to build stuff with the wood from the trees and possibly allow the player to jump on these wooden blocks.
