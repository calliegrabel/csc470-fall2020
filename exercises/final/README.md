# Design for Final Exam
## Gameplay Description
Fall Guys is a game that recently came out that was offered for free and I really enjoyed the aspect that there are multiple different mini games that you have to get through. Although my game will obviously not be an multi-player online game, I want to take the same ideas and create mutliple different scenes with unique minigames.
## Input
There will be a platformer character that will go through the minigames by racing through an obstacle course, completing memorization games, and matching games. There will be a timer countdown on the minigames that have an obstacle course that counts down because the player must make it to the finish line before the timer runs out. To jump, the user will hit space and use the other basic controls to turn and move around. 
## Visual Style
The visuals will be very very bright colors, with each scene of each minigame being a different set of bright colors.
## Audio Style
The music will be very cheerful music; however, when the player has to make a decision or time is beginning to run out the music will begin to speed up. Also, when the player completes all levels, there will be new music.There will also be unique audio for when the player jumps or falls to its death.
## Interface Sketches
The main screen will allow you to choose your characters color and give it a name. It will have a start button and a section of the top three high scores of times to complete all the levels.
## Story/Theme Description
The game is supposed to be fun and bright for people of all ages to see how quickly they can accomplish different minigames that test their knowledge and gaming ability.

# Set Targets
## Low bar
Three different mini games. One an obstacle course, one a matching, and one a memorization game. The timer will count down for the obstacle course and if it finishes before the player passes the finish line, the player must start the levels all over again. The same goes if the player falls off of the obstacle course or gets a part of the memorization or mathcing incorrect.
## Expected
This one will do the same as above, but will keep track of high scores, allow the player to change names and colors, and will have music and audio tied to it.
## High-bar
This one will be the same as above, but will have five levels and more audio attached to certain player actions, like jumping. It will also randomize the order of the minigames for the player to go through so that it is not always the same.
